# Docker GitHub Action Example

![Main Branch CI](https://github.com/danydodson/whale-demo/workflows/Main%20Branch%20CI/badge.svg?branch=main) ![Nightly Test](https://github.com/danydodson/whale-demo/workflows/Nightly%20Test/badge.svg?branch=main)

Welcome. This is a simple example application to show a common Docker specific
GitHub Action setup. We have a Python Flask application that is built and
deployed in Docker containers using Dockerfiles and Docker Compose.

## Docker Actions v2

- üö™ [Docker Login](https://github.com/docker/login-action)
- üõ† [Setup Buildx](https://github.com/docker/setup-buildx-action)
- üé≠ [Setup Cross Platform Builds](https://github.com/docker/setup-qemu-action)
- üî® [Docker Build](https://github.com/docker/build-push-action)

## CI Setup

We want to setup CI to test:

- ‚úí [Every commit to `main`](https://github.com/danydodson/whale-demo/blob/main/.github/workflows/main-ci.yml)
- ‚úâ [Every PR](https://github.com/danydodson/whale-demo/blob/main/.github/workflows/pr-ci.yml)
- üåÉ [Integration tests nightly](https://github.com/danydodson/whale-demo/blob/main/.github/workflows/nightly.yml)
- üê≥ [Releases via tags pushed to Docker Hub.](https://github.com/danydodson/whale-demo/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml)

We are going to use GitHub Actions for the CI infrastructure. Since its local to
GitHub Actions and free when used inside GitHub Actions we're going to [use the
new GitHub Container Registry to hold a copy of a nightly Docker
image.](https://github.com/danydodson/whale-demo/blob/main/.github/workflows/main-ci.yml#L45-L51)

After CI when it comes time for production we want to use Docker's new Amazon
ECS integration to deploy from Docker Compose directly to Amazon ECS with
Fargate. So we will [push our release tagged images to Docker Hub](https://github.com/danydodson/whale-demo/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml)
which is integrated directly Amazon ECS [via Docker Compose.](https://github.com/danydodson/whale-demo/blob/main/docker-compose.yml)

The [Dockerfile](https://github.com/danydodson/whale-demo/blob/main/app/Dockerfile) is setup to use multi stage builds. We have stages for
[`test`](https://github.com/danydodson/whale-demo/blob/main/app/Dockerfile#L9-L12)
and [`prod`](https://github.com/danydodson/whale-demo/blob/main/app/Dockerfile#L14-L16).
This means we'll need Docker Buildx and we can use the a preview of the
new Docker Buildx Action. This is going to let us achieve a couple awesome outcomes:

- We are going to use the buildx backend by default. Buildx out of the box brings a
  number of improvements over the default `docker build`. [Here.](https://github.com/danydodson/whale-demo/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml#L40-L42)
- We are going to setup buildx caching to take advantage of the GitHub Action Cache.
  You should see build performance improvements when repeating builds with common
  layers. [Here.](https://github.com/danydodson/whale-demo/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml#L44-L50)
  [Here.](https://github.com/danydodson/whale-demo/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml#L70-L71)
- We are going to setup QEMU to do cross platform builds. In the example, we'll
  build this application for every Linux architecture that Docker Hub supports. [Here.](https://github.com/danydodson/whale-demo/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml#L35-L38) [Here.](https://github.com/danydodson/whale-demo/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml#L67)

</p>

I'm not going to have GitHub Action manage the deployment side of this example.
Mostly because I don't want to leave an Amazon ECS cluster running. But you can
see a demo of this in one of my past streams: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfQrgZFq_P0

## GitHub Container Registry FAQ

### Where does this `secret.GHCR_TOKEN` come from?

The secret isn't automatically populated. The original GitHub Packages container registry did use the automatically generated `GITHUB_TOKEN`. GitHub has said that support for that will be added to this new registry in the future.

<br>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Support for Actions through GITHUB_TOKEN is coming.</p>&mdash; Bryan Clark (@clarkbw) <a href="https://twitter.com/clarkbw/status/1300853015113396225?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 1, 2020</a></blockquote>

<br>

For now you will need to create a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) which you can do by going here: https://github.com/settings/tokens

You'll need to create the PAT with the correct scopes which you can find here: https://docs.github.com/en/packages/getting-started-with-github-container-registry/migrating-to-github-container-registry-for-docker-images#authenticating-with-the-container-registry

Once you have the PAT you can create an action secret: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets

You can call the secret whatever you want. But `GHCR_TOKEN` is what I used for the example above.

### I thought GHCR had anonymous pulls?

Its a beta product so the documentation doesn't really exist yet. If you dig around on
[GitHub's Community site](https://github.community/tag/ghcr) you can find some answers.
Thats a pain so here is what I've found.

`ghcr.io` is private by default. You'll notice in the [nightly.yml](.github/workflows/nightly.yml) I had to do a login to be able to pull the image.

You can see what packages you have by going here (change the username): https://github.com/USERNAME?tab=packages&visibility=private

You can make it public going to the packages settings (change the username and project name): https://github.com/users/USERNAME/packages/container/PROJECTNAME/settings

## Compose sample application
### express-app-testing-demo


This project is a simple express app for demonstrating testing and code coverage.
[Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) and
[Supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest) are used for testing.
Jest is also used for mocking functions and measuring code coverage.
Note that this app only focuses on server-side JavaScript testing.


### Requirements

* Node.js - [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)


### Getting Started

* Clone the repo
* Install dependencies with `npm install`
* Run server with `npm start` and go here:
[http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)


### Running Tests

* Run unit and integration tests: `npm test`
* Run end-to-end tests: `npm run test:e2e`

### Code Coverage Report

A new code coverage report is generated every time `npm test` runs.
Normally this coverage report is ignored by git.
This project includes it in source control so the coverage report can be viewed in the demo app:
[http://express-app-testing-demo.herokuapp.com/coverage/lcov-report/index.html](http://express-app-testing-demo.herokuapp.com/coverage/lcov-report/index.html)

## Compose sample application

### Python/Flask application

Project structure:

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yaml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app
 ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile
 ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt
 ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py

```

[_docker-compose.yaml_](docker-compose.yaml)

```
services:
  web:
    build: app
    ports:
      - '5000:5000'
```

## Deploy with docker-compose

```
$ docker-compose up -d
Creating network "flask_default" with the default driver
Building web
Step 1/6 : FROM python:3.7-alpine
...
...
Status: Downloaded newer image for python:3.7-alpine
Creating flask_web_1 ... done

```

## Expected result

Listing containers must show one container running and the port mapping as below:

```
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                        COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                  NAMES
c126411df522        flask_web                    "python3 app.py"         About a minute ago  Up About a minute   0.0.0.0:5000->5000/tcp flask_web_1
```

After the application starts, navigate to `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser or run:

```
$ curl localhost:5000
Hello Docker and GitHub!
```

Stop and remove the containers

```
$ docker-compose down
``` -->
